                           <p class="project_card_about">Hello, my name is Gloria Sanchez, a student at San Jose State University. As I enjoy creating Artwork that attempts to be mesmerizing to the eye of the viewer. My work is created through the use of Digital Mediums; Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate, Premier Pro, and much more. I find joy in creating work that not only reflects the natural beauty of life but as well as humorous work to bring a smile to a viewer's face. In order for me to achieve this perspective, I rely on creating work with immersive realism. In an attempt to my humorous work, I capture the joys and beauty in my life to share with the viewer in hopes they benefit from it as well. Creating a space of comfort within my work in an effort to positively impact the viewer, as many have struggled seriously with their life. I believe sharing my work could bring light and influence the viewer to enjoy the small beauties in their life as well.</p>
